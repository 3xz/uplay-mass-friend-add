# uPlay Mass Friend Add extension

## About

Adds a \<textarea\> where you can throw line-break delimited usernames to add to uPlay.

## Installation

You will need a browser that supports Chrome's extensions (Chrome, Firefox 45+, Opera, etc)

## Usage

1. Install
2. Go to the Friends section of the Ubisoft Club (For example, https://club.ubi.com/#!/en-GB/friends)
3. Fill in the text box that appears under the "Enter player's name" search bar. 
![Fill in text form and hit Add Friends](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/3xz/uplay-mass-friend-add/master/add_friends.png)
4. Hit "Add friends" and wait
5. Done! -- Hopefully there weren't any errors!

(You will have to refresh the page to see the "pending invitations" number change.)

## Notes

* I've yet to polish this, so the feedback the script gives is not very user friendly. 
* The text form will only take uPlay usernames. :P

Cheers!
