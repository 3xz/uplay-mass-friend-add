# uPlay Mass Friend Add userscript

## About

Adds a <textarea> where you can throw line-break delimited usernames to add to uPlay.

## Installation

You will need either:

* [GreaseMonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) (Firefox)
* [TamperMonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo) (Chrome)

If you're on a different browser, you're looking for an extension that'll let you use userscripts.

## Usage

1. [Install]() userscript
2. Go to the Friends section of the Ubisoft Club (For example, https://club.ubi.com/#!/en-GB/friends)
3. Fill in the text box that appears under the "Enter player's name" search bar.

4. Hit "Add friends" and wait
5. Done! -- Hopefully there weren't any errors!

(You will have to refresh the page to see the "pending invitations" number change.)
